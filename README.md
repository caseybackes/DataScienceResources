# DataScienceResources
Diverse collection of modern resources for Data Science. Resources included will be of a wide range of formats, mediums, and for various levels of experience.  
When adding resources to this README, the markdown format is

`[Text that has link](link to resource) Explanation of what someone can expect to find or learn from this resource.`

[Markdown Cheetsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#code) Quick reference to markdown syntax. 

## Mathematical Resources
###
[Seeing Theory](https://seeing-theory.brown.edu/index.html): A visual introduction to probability and statistics

## Programming Resources
### EDA
[Pandas Profiling](https://github.com/pandas-profiling/pandas-profiling) An amazingly effective 'quick and dirty' tool for EDA.
### Data Visualization
[5 Python Libraries for Creating Interactive Plots](https://mode.com/blog/python-interactive-plot-libraries)
[D3.js](https://d3js.org/) "Data Driven Documents"(D3) is a JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data. D3 helps you bring data to life using HTML, SVG, and CSS. D3â€™s emphasis on web standards gives you the full capabilities of modern browsers without tying yourself to a proprietary framework, combining powerful visualization components and a data-driven approach to DOM manipulation.
[Data Visualization with D3.js - Full Tutorial Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8V5o2UHG0E&t=14028s) Tutorial by freeCodeCamp.org on YouTube. This is a full *12 hour* course, but can be a critical tool for data visulization and communication for the modern Data Scientist.
 
## Development Resources
### Frameworks
#### Django
