# DataScienceResources
*December 2019*

Diverse collection of modern resources for Data Science. Resources included will be of a wide range of formats, mediums, and for various levels of experience. Over time, this repo is inteneded to grow as contributors around the world offer more resources. As the repo grows, more directories will be added and content may be segmented as appropriate. If you have / know of a resource that would help other people, please submit a pull request (actively managed).

When adding resources to this README, the markdown format is

`[Text to hyperlink](https://link-to-resource.org) Explanation of what someone can expect to find or learn from this resource. This renders below as...`

[Markdown Cheetsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#code) Quick reference to markdown syntax. 

## Mathematical Resources
###
[Seeing Theory](https://seeing-theory.brown.edu/index.html): A visual introduction to probability and statistics

## Programming Resources
### EDA
[Pandas Profiling](https://github.com/pandas-profiling/pandas-profiling) An amazingly effective 'quick and dirty' tool for EDA.
### Data Visualization
[5 Python Libraries for Creating Interactive Plots](https://mode.com/blog/python-interactive-plot-libraries)

[D3.js](https://d3js.org/) "Data Driven Documents"(D3) is a JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data. D3 helps you bring data to life using HTML, SVG, and CSS. D3’s emphasis on web standards gives you the full capabilities of modern browsers without tying yourself to a proprietary framework, combining powerful visualization components and a data-driven approach to DOM manipulation.

[Data Visualization with D3.js - Full Tutorial Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8V5o2UHG0E&t=14028s) Tutorial by freeCodeCamp.org on YouTube. This is a full *12 hour* course, but can be a critical tool for data visulization and communication for the modern Data Scientist.
 
## Development Resources
### Frameworks
#### Django
[Django Docs](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/)

[Django Web App Series.](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-osiE80TeTtoQCKZ03TU5fNfx2UY6U4p) Of the popular web development frameworks in circulation, django is built specifically with/for python apps, making it a great production tool for a Data Scientist's side projects and professional projects. Series is taught by education content creator, [Corey Schafer](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCezIgC97PvUuR4_gbFUs5g).
#### Flask
[Flask Docs](https://www.fullstackpython.com/flask.html) Flask is a great framework for quick and dirty app development.

[Flask Web App Tutorial Series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwZwr5Tvyxo) by Corey Schafer. Link goes to video #1 in the series. 
### Back-end Engineering
#### PostgreSQL
[Psql Cheetsheet.](http://gpdb.docs.pivotal.io/archive/gs/43/pdf/PSQLQuickRef.pdf) Handy reference quide for interacting with PostgreSQL. 
#### Docker
[Docker Docs](https://www.docker.com/why-docker) Containerization of applications that mitigates incompatibility across devices, operating systems, and configurations. 

[Docker for Beginners Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqMOX6JJhGo) In this course you will learn Docker through a series of lectures that use animation, illustration and some fun analogies that simply complex concepts, we have demos that will show how to install and get started with Docker and most importantly we have hands-on labs that you can access right in your browser. From freeCodeCamp.org. 

### Front-end Engineering
#### Styling 
[Bootstrap4](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/navbar/) CSS styling library for highly professionally designed CSS components - a critical resource for web-based DS projects. 

### System Hacks
[htop from Brew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/htop) an interactive process viewer for Unix systems. It is a text-mode application (for console or X terminals) and requires ncurses. [Take a video tour of htop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw2ZUf0hTF8&t=575s)

*CD up alias* 
Add the following alias to the .bash_profile through vi(m) or nano.

`alias ..="cd .."`

`alias ...="cd ../.."`

`alias ....="cd ../../.."`

Save the file, exit the text editor, and re-source the .bash_profile

`$ source .bash_profile`

## "Reading+" Material
### Blogs
[Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/) Great blog from various authors and practioners in the field. 
### Podcasts
[Towards Data Science Podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/towards-data-science/id1470952338) Amazing guests share their current DS work. Great way to stay abreast of the broad application landscape in DS. 

## Grab Bag (misc)
#### Video Content
